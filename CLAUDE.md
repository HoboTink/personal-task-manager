# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a simple Python learning repository containing basic Python scripts. The repository appears to be used for educational purposes and experimenting with Claude Code functionality.

## Common Commands

### Running Python Scripts
```bash
python hello.py
python filename.py
```

### File Operations
- Use the LS tool in Claude Code to list files
- Standard Python file operations apply

## Code Architecture

This is a minimal repository structure:
- `hello.py` - Basic Python script demonstrating print statements and string formatting
- `README.md` - Personal learning journal documenting progress with Claude Code

## Development Notes

- This repository focuses on Python basics and file operations
- The existing code uses simple print statements and basic variable assignment
- No complex frameworks or dependencies are currently in use

## Project Guidelines

- Always start a new project in plan mode
